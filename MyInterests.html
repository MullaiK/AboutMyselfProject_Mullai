<h1> My Interests</h1>
<h2> Singing </h2>

<p>I love to hear songs and sing them loud in my own way. My interest for singing lasted in me from childhood . I still remeber the days me and my sister sing songs in front of the mirror with comb in our hands imaginging that is the mike. After getting to job I got a very few time to listen songs , but still they heal all the work pressure in the half hour drive from my office to home.<p>

<p>I love dancing a lot same as singing me and my sister will fight for the mirror . No matter which ever song we dance that will still to the small mirror.After you dance you will feel the day refreshing . I used to get up early in morning just to dance for sun music songs. Will never miss opportunity of dance .<p>

<p>Cooking is my first hobby infact I used to play fireless cooking in my childhood with choppu samanam. We used get leaves and prepare some curry obviously no one eats , we just pretend. My first dish is sandwith with tomato and onion curry in between two toasted bread. My father was happy for my first dish and i still remeber the moment. Even in my busy work days me and my friend vanmathi used to cook some dish in open stove near street in our PG and eat . That was all fun . Even now I like trying new dishes. <p>
